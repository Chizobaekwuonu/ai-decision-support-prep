# AI and Data Analytics Explorations
This repository contains a set of exploratory projects focused on forecasting, natural-language reasoning, and analytics. These projects were created to strengthen my practical skills in data science, machine learning and applied AI, and to build a foundation for more advanced research or technical study.

## 1. Time-Series Forecasting (forecasting.ipynb)
A 24-month synthetic demand dataset was used to explore patterns, seasonality, and predictive behaviour using ARIMA modelling.
**What I did:**
- Loaded and cleaned time-series data  
- Performed exploratory data analysis  
- Created a train/test split  
- Fitted an ARIMA(2,1,2) model  
- Visualised forecast vs actual results  
**What I learned:**
Time-series models can capture underlying trends well but are sensitive to sudden changes or unexpected spikes. This highlighted the need for flexible decision tools that combine predictive analytics with real-world context.

## 2. Natural-Language Decision Agent (decision_agent.ipynb)
A lightweight decision-support prototype built using the FLAN-T5 Base model. The agent takes natural-language questions and generates structured, step-by-step responses.
**What I did:**
- Loaded an instruction-tuned LLM  
- Designed prompts for clarity and structure  
- Tested the model with real-world decision-making scenarios  
**What I learned:**
LLMs are powerful for generating structured reasoning and explanations, but require careful prompt design and human oversight. This exercise strengthened my understanding of natural-language processing and practical AI applications.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming  
- Data manipulation (Pandas)  
- Time-series forecasting  
- Model evaluation and visualisation  
- Prompt engineering  
- Working with open-source LLMs  
- Exploratory analysis and structured reporting  

## Purpose
These projects serve as a foundation for developing deeper technical expertise in analytics, optimisation, and artificial intelligence. They reflect my interest in building practical tools, understanding model behaviour, and applying data-driven thinking to real-world challenges.
